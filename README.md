## Credits

This project was initially born by the reading of the amazing series of articles [Let’s Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/) written by Ruslan Spivak.

I would also like to mention the project [CInterpreter](https://github.com/SKantar/CInterpreter) created by Slađan Kantar that inspired me during the development of this interpreter.
